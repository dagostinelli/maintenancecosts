# Curate your Code

What's that quote: 

> What's that famous quote about knowing when a project is finished when you have nothing else left to remove?

You don't write great code by finding a way to include every single great idea ever invented into your code base.  That's a mess.  That's over designed. That is costly. Stop it.  What makes code great is knowing when you are done.  The curator's job is toe make a conscious decision about what *stays* in the code and what has to go.  

Including a lot of libraries. Kitchen sink.  

Build a climate of curation.

Software has an expiration date. Set it from the start.  Live up to it.
