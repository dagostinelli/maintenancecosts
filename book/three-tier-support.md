# Three Tier Support System

- Level 1 - Front-Line Support
- Level 2 - Expert Support Specialists
- Level 3 - Programmers

Community support is not support. It is users helping users. Your own team can and should certainly jump in, but this does not count as support in the sense that is being presented here.  Community support exists to take the load off the regular 3-tiers of support.  Community Support can be effective when the load is very high, the questions repetitive and non-intuitive or there is a language or communication barrier.
