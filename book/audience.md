## Audience

Who is this book for? 

It's for managers.  It's for architect-level developers.

I make the distinction that developers go throught the following progression:

	- Entry-Level Programmer (Novice)
	- Senior Developer (Journeyman)
	- Architect (Master)

Many will disagree with this.  Usually it has to do with trying to compare a senior developer in a particular technology stack to an architect in another technology stack.

This book is for anyone trying to make good technology choices.  I don't expect this book to radically alter your thinking.  Instead, I hope to course-correct your approach.
