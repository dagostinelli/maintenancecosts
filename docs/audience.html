It's for architect-level developers. </p><p> I make the distinction that developers go throught the following progression: </p><pre><code>- Entry-Level Programmer (Novice)
- Senior Developer (Journeyman)
- Architect (Master)
</code></pre><p> Many will disagree with this. Usually it has to do with trying to compare a senior developer in a particular technology stack to an architect in another technology stack. </p><p> This book is for anyone trying to make good technology choices. I don't expect this book to radically alter your thinking. Instead, I hope to course-correct your approach. </p> </div> </div> <footer> &copy; 2018-2018 Darryl T. Agostinelli </footer> </body></html>
