 Curate your Code

 What's that quote:

 <p>
  What's that famous quote about knowing when a project is finished when you have nothing else left to remove?
 </p>

<p>
 You don't write great code by finding a way to include every single great idea ever invented into your code base.  That's a mess.  That's over designed. That is costly. Stop it.  What makes code great is knowing when you are done.  The curator's job is toe make a conscious decision about what
 <em>
  stays
 </em>
 in the code and what has to go.
</p>
<p>
 Including a lot of libraries. Kitchen sink.
</p>
<p>
 Build a climate of curation.

 Software has an expiration date. Set it from the start.  Live up to it.
